## Music Manager

> A Music Player dveloped using JavaScript, CSS and HTML. JS was used to implement a Linked List data structure to represent the playlist. Each node in the Linked List stored information about each song. Users can add new songs, remove songs from the playlist, access the current playlist, repeat the current song and shuffle the playlist. These features were implemented using Queues data structure.
